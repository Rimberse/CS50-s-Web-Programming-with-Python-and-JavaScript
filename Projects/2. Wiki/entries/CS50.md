# CS50

**CS50 (Computer Science 50)** is an on-campus and online introductory course on computer science taught at Harvard University and Yale University. In 2016, CS50 became available to high school students as an Advanced Placement Computer Science course. The on-campus version is Harvard's largest class with 800 students, 102 staff and up to 2,200 participants in their regular hackathons.

The course material is available online for free on the EdX platform, with a range of certificates available for a fee. As of 2022, this online version, called CS50x, teaches the languages C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also teaches fundamental computer-science concepts including arrays and data structures, and the Flask web framework. The 2021 iteration of the course introduced three new additional lectures on computer security, artificial Intelligence, and the ethics of technology.

The lead instructor is Harvard professor David Malan. Brian Yu is also a former member of CS50 and was one of the lecturers. Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and former Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer have given guest lectures.

Several follow-on programs exist, focusing on web programming, artificial intelligence, game development, and mobile apps.
